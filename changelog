version 0.0.7
- new pin mapping for Revision 2 boards, see https://projects.drogon.net/raspberry-pi/wiringpi/pins/ and http://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/2012/06/simple-guide-to-the-rpi-gpio-header-and-pins/

version 0.0.6
- new reading method File.new and f.getc/rewind that gets into ~35 microsecond reads instead of ~55 microsecond IO.new io.getc/rewind and ~350 microsecond reads with IO.read
- typed input/output pins, mainly to prepare for pwm, bidirectional/1wire, and more
- organized folders for devices/pins/sensors

version 0.0.5
- date bump

version 0.0.4
- major changes to reading/writing from/to gpio including checking permissions with hands free fallback to older sudo method
- path_write method checks permissions and writes using IO.write for performance and falls back to shelling out to sudo echo
- using IO.read and Dir.methods where possible for performance gains, added self.pin_prefix
- raspberry_pi.rb => device.rb: moved methods that are now generic enough to be in device.
- extracted paths to separate methods to allow for generic gpio methods to be moved to device and allow raspberr_pi.rb and other modules that extend device to be configuration.
- removed sudo from reads, only needed for writes
- print pin in error message raised
- benchmarks added to see timings of different methods of reading/writing
- found new methods of reading file that may be viable for microsecond intervals

version 0.0.3
- updated readme with example
- example usage code added
- example sensor of motion_detector added
- sensor class added
- raspberry_pi module extends device module

version 0.0.2
- device/rasberrypi now modules instead of class
- pin.new(params) now pass hash of params to pin.new {pin: 1, mode: :in, device: :RaspberryPi}
- pin.new now has default if no device is passed in
- lib files now load properly

version 0.0.1: initial public release
- proof of concept / prototype
